# triggeredGASSP
This repository contains the GPI nodes and network used to reconstruct phase contrast MRI images presented in the manuscript "Phase contrast coronary blood velocity mapping with both high temporal and spatial resolution using triggered Golden Angle rotated Spiral k-t Sparse Parallel imaging (GASSP) with shifted binning".
Example data is included.

# Installation
Clone this repo into your ~/gpi directory by entering:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jhu-cardiac-mri/triggeredGASSP.git triggeredGASSP

Rescan for new nodes or restart GPI to include the new nodes in the GPI library.
